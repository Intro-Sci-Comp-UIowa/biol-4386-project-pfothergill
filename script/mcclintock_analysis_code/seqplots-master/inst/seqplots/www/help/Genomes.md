Genomes managment
=================

The `Manage reference genomes` tab allows to add or remove reference genomes installed with SeqPlots. New genomes are added to user data folder, so they can be easily moved along with data and would not be removed when updating R or SeqPlots. User can choose to install standard genomes package available with Bioconductor or install forged genomic package from local file.
